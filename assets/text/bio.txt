Hey! I'm Eurylochus, the second-in-command to Odysseus. I'm currently on my way back to Ithaca, my homeland, dodging many monsters and tricky situations along the way. I post here about what's going on in my life. I frequently rant about Odysseus and his "heroism," but for now, I suppose I'll have to put up with it. Looking forward to getting back to Ithaca!
