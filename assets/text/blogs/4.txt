We did escape, somehow. Polyphemus missed us when he led the animals outside, though he did notice one was especially slow. It didn't occur to him that one of us might be under the slow animal. Still, luck was involved, and this doesn't indicate that Odysseus was correct to lead us into the caveâ€” we could have died.

Odysseus (after escaping), being his usual self, boasted to Polyphemus, taunted him, and told him that he was Odysseus. He thinks everything is fine; he is too egotistical. His taunting only seemed to make Polyphemus angrier. And oh--what luck!-- Polyphemus just happens to be Poseidon's son! The God of the Sea hates us, and our life is on the sea. Odysseus is too arrogant.

We soon arrived at another island. We found an interesting palace, and some crew members went inside because they saw a woman weaving, who invited them in. Sometimes, I feel the members don't think things through; they just do. Pretty sure this is a trick. We don't have a good relationship (or any relationship at all) with this person. Whoever lives there could be mean and end our lives. Isn't this the lesson we took away from the Polyphemus incident? The same thing could happen with a worse ending, and this feels like a repeat. I would feel scared if a bunch of random soldiers came to my house, and I might try to harm them. I'll be waiting here, just in case.
