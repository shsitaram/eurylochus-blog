We arrived at the island. Odysseus has claimed that we cannot come on the island of the cattle! After all we've been through! This is unacceptable; we have endured so much, and he won't give us a bit of food and relaxation? I could tell everyone else was disappointed and couldn't take it any longer; a captain can't treat his crew like this. I felt, as second-in-command, that it was my job to create a mutiny if there will ever be one. I thought about this further: how is Odysseus himself managing this? How is he able to go so long without rest? He must be made of iron. I spoke to Odysseus. He allowed us to stop at the island, but nothing more-- no food. I suppose this is fine; not that great, but at least he's giving us something.
