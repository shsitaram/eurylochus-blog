I supposed the men were gone forever. When I was back, I was in tears for the men but knew I had to move on. I narrated what happened to Odysseus. To my shock, he wanted to go back to save them— something I hadn't even considered! Why would he go back when they were clearly gone? We could die; we might as well escape with our lives. But no— Odysseus had to be the "hero" he always is and will be and risk our lives. At least he let me stay behind. A flood of worries crossed my mind: what if Odysseus dies and doesn't come out? Will we ever leave this place? Will we have to live here forever? The woman must have been quite powerful to kill all of the crewmates who went in; Odysseus doesn't have the strength of so many men— why will he receive a different fate? But wait... will I become the captain then? Maybe this isn't so bad after all if Odysseus will finally be gone from our lives. I will always keep those who died in my heart, though.
