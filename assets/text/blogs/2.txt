It looks like Odysseus is failing. Polyphemus (the Cyclops) returned to his cave (where we were) and first did some chores, ignoring us completely. It was scary and suspenseful. When he blocked the entrance with a stone, I knew we were going to die. He ate some men already, so I'm sure we will all die. Odysseus is planning to place a spear into Polyphemus's eye. I think that Odysseus sometimes forgets who he's dealing withâ€” Odysseus is a human, and his opponent is a Cyclops! What if the Cyclops awakens right before we place the spear? What if he hears us walking closer to him? This might be my last post. I hope I'll be able to see you guys again.
