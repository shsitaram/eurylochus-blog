We survived, and Polyphemus is now blind. Odysseus cleverly made him drunk and placed the spear into Polyphemus's eye. That was quite an interesting move by Odysseus and a successful one, too. Next, Odysseus would have us cling to the bellies of Polyphemus’s animals. 

I sensed many things wrong with this plan, but I wasn't planning on saying anything because I realized we didn't have much hope anyway. Again, many things could go wrong: could Polyphemus detect us through other senses? (Since a Cyclops has only one eye, perhaps his other senses are enhanced?) Won't it be evident that his animals are heavy?

We'll see what happens (maybe we somehow survive or Odysseus knows something that I don't?)... We’ll be hanging from animals right after I finish writing this.
