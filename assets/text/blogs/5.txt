I knew this would happen. They aren't coming out! They must have been killed by the woman inside. I wept for them. I knew that we had to leave this place, and fast. Odysseus, even being the crazy heroic person that he isâ€” I am sure he will understand that we have to leave once he sees the imminent danger we are in. I am perturbed for them and feel bad that I couldn't have done more to help them; I'll be returning to Odysseus to tell him of this disaster. I hope we can leave this place soon!
