It's been a while since I posted. Odysseus came back, and initially, I thought that he had made up a story that the person who lived there, Circe, was a nice person. Of course, I was shocked that he could think such a thing, but I was eventually convinced (reluctantly) to stay. It was not a bad place, but Odysseus took a significant risk to come here; I'm still not completely sure how he survived. Anyway, he got me and the crew to stay a year and it has not been all that bad. I am quite worried for Odysseus and the crew in general; I feel Odysseus is becoming too confident in his abilities (more than he originally was, which I wasn't sure was possible) because he gets extremely lucky every time he takes a risk. One day, this will get him into trouble...
