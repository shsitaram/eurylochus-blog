Well, well, well... Odysseus "the Great" strikes again. We were sailing off to Ithaca peacefully when we came to the island of the Cyclops'. Grabbing some cheese and stealing some lambs would be great, but Odysseus must be "heroic." Here's how it happened: we started venturing in for some cheese; all was good. Now Odysseus refuses to return to the ship and wants to see the Cyclops who lived there!

So many things might go wrong here: what if the Cyclops consumes us all in one big gulp? What if he enslaves us for life? Our fate is in the hands of some Cyclops we're trusting will be nice to us.

After lighting a fire, making a sacrifice, and eating some cheese, we (the crewmates, Odysseus, and I) sit anxiously, waiting for the Cyclops.
