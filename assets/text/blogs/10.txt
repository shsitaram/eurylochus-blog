Now I'm returning to my thoughts; the other crewmates would look to me to perform a mutiny. We've been on the sea for so long, and Odysseus won't even allow us food now. As I think about this more, Odysseus doesn't care-- he's never cared that much about his crewmates. He didn't even mention those who died in Polyphemus's cave. What is a captain who doesn't care about his crew? I realized that, due to my oath (where I promised Odysseus I wouldn't eat the cattle), I might die if I ate the cattle. But Odysseus's foolish heroism will kill us anyway at some point. He is too blind to his values; he only wants to be a hero and can't control himself. I have convinced the crew to eat the cattle with me; we may die, but at least we'll have a good meal. I'll let you know what happens in my next post.
