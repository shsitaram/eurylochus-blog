It's been a while since I posted. So much has happened! We left Circe's island a while ago, and to all our dismay, Odysseus made us go to the underworld ("because Circe said so") and back to Circe's island for more information. We then passed the monsters Scylla and Charybdis (again, due to Odysseus's "lucky heroism"), but some men died. I feel despondent for them and think Odysseus genuinely feels the same, though I'm not completely sure. I am getting furious with him and don't feel like he's doing the right thing; he takes too many risks, and I feel he doesn't care too much about his crew. Of course, I can't do too much right now. On the bright side, it looks like there is some cattle on an island up ahead (maybe we will get some meat)!
